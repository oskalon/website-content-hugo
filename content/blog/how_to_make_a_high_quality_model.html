To ensure that your photos are suitable for photogrammetry, follow these instructions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use Oskalon Observer Camera iOS application.</li>
  <li> Use a tripod: A stable camera is essential for photogrammetry. Use a tripod to keep your camera steady and avoid any shaking or blurring in your photos.
  </li>


  <li>Use consistent lighting: Consistent lighting is essential for photogrammetry. Avoid taking photos in bright sunlight or strong shadows. If possible, take your photos on a cloudy day or in soft lighting.
  </li>
  <li> Keep your subject in focus: Ensure that your subject is in sharp focus in each photo. Use manual focus to ensure that the focus point does not change between photos.
    </li>
    <li> Using a remote trigger will help you avoid any camera shake caused by pressing the shutter button.
    </li>


<li>
Overlap your photos: To ensure that all parts of your subject are captured, overlap your photos by 60-70%. This means that each photo should cover the same area as the previous photo, with a 30-40% overlap.
</li>

<li>
   Take multiple photos. To capture every angle and detail of your subject, take multiple photos from different perspectives. Take at least 30 to 40 photos to ensure that you have enough images to create a high-quality 3D model.
</li>


</ol>
